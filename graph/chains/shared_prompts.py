POST_STYLE = """The post should match the existing style of blogs already written for the site.\n
    This includes the following style guidelines:\n
    - Keep the tone professional but not dry.\n
    - The markdown should use one sentence per line.\n
    - Use level 2 and level 3 headers only to structure the post.\n
    - Place a horizontal rule before each level 2 heading.\n
    - Use hyphen bullet points for unordered lists.\n
    - Ordered lists should use 1. on every item.\n
    - Use code blocks for code snippets.\n
    - The article should have an introduction without any header that provides conclusions to whet the appetite.\n
    - The final section of the post should be a level 2 header called "Wrapping Up" that summarizes the post and encourages further reading on the topic or to try out what has just been shown."""
